  <h2>Cultural Description!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The security shocked me a lot because Vancouver is more secure than Ecuador.</li>
    <li>The amount of people that are homeless and also in bad conditions around downtown shocked me a lot, you don't see that kind of reality in Ecuador. Maybe in poor poor sections, but in main places like, Downtown in Vancouver and for example, Quito or Cumbayá, never going to see people in the worst conditions. I hope this get fixed.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>I miss being with my friends and family a lot.</li>
    <li>Ecuador food is also something that i miss a lot and i cannot find here in Vancouver.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>I love outdoors activity that you can do in Vancouver like snowboarding, hiking with incredible landscapes, meeting people around the world.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3> Personal Goal</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Be Succesfull in Cybersecurity field and manage to have a job in the intelligence or maybe in ONU so I can solve digital issues, ilegal activity and hopefully work in the military it could be in my country.</li>
  </ul>
